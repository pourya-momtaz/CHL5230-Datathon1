# Public Health Data Analytics Datathon

This GitHub repository hosts code and resources for the CHL5230 Datathon1. This datathon focuses on addressing the challenge of obesity and its implications for public health. Additionally, we explore correlations between obesity and lung cancer risk factors to develop innovative solutions for these pressing health issues.

## Objective

The main objectives of this datathon are:

1. **Thorough Data Analysis**: Analyze the provided datasets to uncover meaningful patterns and insights related to obesity. These findings will inform decision-makers in crafting effective surveillance and intervention strategies.

2. **Correlation and Integration**: Integrate data on lung cancer risk factors from a research paper on Ethiopia to identify underlying patterns and risk factors. This enables exploration of the intersections between obesity and lung cancer and the development of models for public health planning.
