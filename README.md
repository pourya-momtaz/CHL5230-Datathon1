## Public Health Data Analytics Datathon

This GitHub repository hosts code and resources for the CHL5230 Datathon1. 

# Introduction

This datathon focuses on addressing the challenge of obesity and its implications for public health. Additionally, we explore correlations between obesity and lung cancer risk factors to develop innovative solutions for these pressing health issues. Through data analysis, we aim to nalyze the provided datasets to uncover meaningful patterns and insights related to obesity. These findings will inform decision-makers in crafting effective surveillance and intervention strategies. We will integrate data on lung cancer risk factors from a research paper on Ethiopia to identify underlying patterns and risk factors. This enables exploration of the intersections between obesity and lung cancer and the development of models for public health planning. Our main question resides in exploring how various factors, including obesity and other factors, influence the severity of lung cancer within a specific population. Specifically, we will look at whether there are gender-based differences that influence of smoking and alcohol consumption on BMI. Thus, we aim to develop machine learning predictive models that can assess the severity of lung cancer and obesity based on input data.

We are provided with the dataset of lung cancer risk factors from Tikur Ambesa Hospital, where how risk factors influence the lung cancer severity will be explored. The dataset of several public health factors that might influence BMI in Canada was also provided, where the Body Mass Index(BMI) is a crucial international standard frequently used to gauge the extent of obesity in humans and can be used to assess a person's nutritional and physical health. We use several health factors to forecast the level of BMI because a higher BMI may be linked to some cancerous conditions.


# Methodology

We define thresholds on BMI on the first dataset to categorize them, so it would be easier to encode. Then we're going to use clustering methods to answer the questions and for the first question we'll train a classifier to learn a relation.

# Data engineering process

The BMI dataset contains 25,355 entries, comprising 14,896 females and 8,639 males. We use the duplication and deleting the null value for data cleaning. For better performance in machine learning, we optimize the gender variable into the dummy variable(‘Male’=0 and ‘Female’=1). Based on the international standard for BMI, we categorized BMI values into five levels: underweight(BMI<18.5), healthy(18.5-24.9), overweight(25-29.9), obese (30-39.9), and severely obese(BMI>=40), and encoding these five levels to 0-4.

The dataset of lung cancer risk factors from Tikur Ambesa Hospital has discrete numerical data with 1000 patients and 11 crucial risk factors. 

For both datasets, all missing values were excluded at the beginning. They were split into training and testing datasets, respectively. Also, their feactures were scaled before KNN was applied on each dataset. 

# Analysis

Our analysis is composed of two parts: the explanatroy analysis and the machine learning modelling analysis. We conducted the explanatory data analysis to visualize any patterins among the explanatory variables, such as the multicollinearities among different lung cancer risk factors or factors affecting obesity/BMI scores.

Machine learning analysis:

As we have labeled data of BMI score and lung cancer severity available in these two datasets, we applied KNN algorithms for both analysis to obtain high accuracy predictions.

First, the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm with k=18 is used in our analysis to forecast BMI levels. Due to the KNN method's superior performance, we divided the dataset into 70% training data and 30% testing data. 

Our first idea is to exclude the 'Height' and 'Weight' variables from the analysis since BMI is already calculated from these two features. The reason for excluding them is to avoid multicollinearity in the model. Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables in a regression model are highly correlated, making it difficult to distinguish the individual effects of each predictor. In this case, 'Height' and 'Weight' are directly used to calculate BMI, so including them would introduce redundancy and could lead to instability in the model's coefficients.

We begin by using the KNN estimator without height and weight. Only 30% of the time is accurate, so there is a weak relationship between BMI and other variables. Therefore, we include the height and weight components in our model for improved performance.

Then, in the lung cancer dataset, we applied KNN on all 10 features with k=3 with the severity of lung cancer as the labelled data. We also tried another KNN with a reduced number of features to further compare their predicting accuracies. We continued with features of Gender, Age, Air Pollution, Alcohol Usage, Genetic Risk, Obesity, and Smoking to reduce multicolinearities. In both KNN models, as all the data are quantitive, we proceeded with the use of Euclidean distance. 
On the plot of modelling accuracies vs. k values, We observed the accuracies remain the approximately highest when k=3, and thus proceeded k=3 to obtain our results. 

# Findings

Explanatory Analysis:

From the correlation heatmap of the BMI dataset, only height and weight show a reasonably high correlation with BMI; other parameters appear to have no correlation with BMI. As a result, the situation is very extreme.

From the correlation heatmap of the lung cancer dataset, it can be seen that the severity of lung cancer does not show correlations with all the risk factors. However, we have found that features of genetic risk, chest pain, alcohol usage, obesity, smoking, coughing of blood have moderate to strong correlations with lung cancer disease. Also, genetic risk, coughing of blood, passive smoker, chest pain, lung disease, and alcohol usage have moderate to strong correlations with obesity. Thus, multicolinearities might exist and should be carefully avoided in the next steps. 

Machine Learning Analysis:

After adding the height and weight factors into the model, the model achieves an overall accuracy of 0.77 with k=20. This means the model correctly classified 77% BMI level based on health factors. 

According to the classification report, "underweight" has a precision of 0.99, while "severely obese" has a precision of 1.00. The precision with other levels is less precise, followed by healthy (0.74), overweight (0.73), and obese (0.80). This demonstrates the model correctly identifying individuals as underweight and severely obese. Recall measures indicate whether a model can recognize every instance of a class. In our data set, the recall of a severely obese case is only 0.08, which may be due to an extremely uncommon severely obese instance. The model performs a wonderful job of recognizing most of the instances of that class, with the exception of the seriously obese, whose recall is in the range of 0.52 to 0.93. 

From the first KNN model that included all features with K setting as 3, we got relatively high precisions with an average of 0.93. In another KNN model that only included important features, we observed slightly lower accuracies with an average of 0.91, thus we will proceed with the KNN model with 10 features, even though potential overfitting might occur.
